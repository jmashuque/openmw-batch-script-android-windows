<h1>OpenMW Batch Script for Android and Windows Users</h1>
<h3>Automate Converting/Modifying openmw.cfg and Downloading/Running openmw-validator, tes3cmd, tr-patcher, OMWLLF, and DeltaPlugin</h3>

This is a relatively simple yet highly functional and customisable batch file meant for both Android and Windows OpenMW users that will completely automate the process of converting or modifying openmw.cfg and running the following apps:

No prompts, no executables, no java, no python, just a small batch file. All you need is your Android or Windows openmw.cfg file and the apps you want to use (if any), and the script does the rest. This script can do many things, the following is a more complex example of one run of the script:

<li>download/unzip all the apps into the right folders</li>
<li>back up openmw.cfg</li>
<li>convert Android to/from Windows paths</li>
<li>enable or disable any lines that match user-specified list of mods</li>
<li>run openmw-validator and read generated log for errors</li>
<li>run tes3cmd clean command or tr-patcher on list of mods specified</li>
<li>back up .omwaddon files</li>
<li>automatically disable the names of .omwaddon files in openmw.cfg and optionally user-specified mods</li>
<li>run OMWLLF and DeltaPlugin</li>
<li>output the .omwaddon files into the user's chosen folder</li>
<li>revert openmw.cfg to before running apps</li>
<li>write lines for .omwaddon files/folder if they don't exist in openmw.cfg</li>
<li>find installation folder of OpenMW and run the game</li>

<br>This is for people like me who do not use a mod manager and prefer a hands-on approach. If you're sick of modifying the Windows openmw.cfg file, running Delta, then converting to Android manually each time you make a change to your mod list, then this is my solution for you. After weeks of painstakingly modding OpenMW Android, one mod at a time, trying different versions and alternatives, checking compatibility, consulting several mod lists and trying to combine them, having to repeatedly change and generate the files, disabling the generated files and additional mods that aren't compatible with DeltaPlugin, I finally came to the conclusion that there's gotta be an easier way. It started off as a simple script of less than fifteen lines. But I kept adding more and more functionality. Eventually I decided there must be others out there who could make use of this script too. So I started expanding it so others could easily modify values and use the features they need. I had to learn a lot about batch files to do this script, with zero use of AI. I hope it makes your life a little easier.

<h4>Current Version: 0.6.1</h4>

<h3>At a Glance:</h3>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

On the right side of this page, under Releases, click the latest version, download the zip, and unpack it somewhere. Firstly you need your latest openmw.cfg file ready, see the batch file for default locations. For Android users, just place the file in the same folder as runme.bat. For Windows users, the openmw.cfg at the default location will be used. Copy the folders for openmw-validator, tr-patcher, OMWLLF and/or DeltaPlugin, into the same folder as runme.bat, if their names match the default values they will be located. For tes3cmd, the executable must be placed inside the Data Files folder. Open variables.txt and change the following values:<br>

<li>convertTo = use windows or android</li>
<li>folderData = location of Data Files folder on Android</li>
<li>replaceData = location of Data Files folder on Windows</li>
<li>folderMod = location of Mods folder on Android</li>
<li>replaceMod = location of Mods folder on Windows</li>
<li>omwaddonFolder = output folder of generated .omwaddon files, must be inside the above Mods folder</li>

<br>After editing the values, save the text file then run the batch file like you would any other file. The default variables.txt will simply convert Android paths to Windows, run openmw-validator, disable the .omwaddon files, run DeltaPlugin, and finally restore the Windows openmw.cfg. You can of course do many other things with this batch file, but that should get you started. See the examples below for more ways to use it. You can also use different versions of variables.txt by using runme.bat through command prompt and supplying the variables file name as an argument. And that's it, now go out there and enjoy your own customised and unique world of Morrowind, on your phone!

Backup is enabled by default, but make a backup elsewhere just in case because backups are overwritten. Read the comments in the batch file for further information on all the options and features. I suggest <strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a></strong> for modifying .bat and .cfg files (it's free). Download all the apps from the links in the top paragraph, you only need the ones you enable. OpenMW doesn't have to be installed if you're an Android user, the OpenMW folder will be created if it doesn't exist. tr-patcher requires <strong><a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">java</a></strong>. OMWLLF requires <strong><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">python</a></strong>. For leveled lists, it is recommended you use only DeltaPlugin as it handles them better than OMWLLF and is still being developed. You can use the included downloader.bat script to automatically download each app necessary, see the script code for more information.

<h2>Examples:</h2>

The variables.txt file can be modified in many ways to suit your preferences. You can add/remove any comments. You can rearrange the variables as you like, and you can add/remove any blank lines too. You can also remove the line for any variable you don't need, excluding the six variables specifically mentioned under Usage. Although, removing a variable will remove its functions. You can also override variables by redefining them at the end of the file, the last definition of a variable will always be used.

<h3>Modify Android Copy Only</h3>
Set convertTo to android and enable ignoreInput.

<h3>Modify Windows Copy Only</h3>
Set convertTo to windows and enable ignoreInput.

<h3>Convert Input Only</h3>
Set convertTo to android or windows, enable ignoreInput and enableReverse.

<h3>Disable/Enable Mod Groupings</h3>
Enable disableSearchExact and modify the appropriate variable depending on what function you're using. For example, you can disable all Tyddy textures that are HQ by specifying:
<pre>
    disableSearchExact=True
    enableDisabler=1
    modsDisabler=Tyddy HQ
</pre>
and the script will match any lines that contain each term in any order.

<h2>Warning:</h2>

Batch files can be very dangerous. They can do some destructive and irreversible things without user interaction or administrative privileges. Do not use batch files from unknown sources unless you understand what malicious code can look like. Do not run this batch file if you did not download it from my GitHub. Do not modify the batch file unless you know what you are doing. This batch file, and downloader.bat, should not ask for administrative privileges or set off standard antivirus software, if it does then stop using it and contact me.
